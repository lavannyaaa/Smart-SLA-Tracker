# Smart SLA Tracker â€” Intelligent Customer Complaint & Escalation Management

## Project Overview

Smart SLA Tracker is a Salesforce-based solution that automates the management of customer complaints and adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs). It replaces manual tracking methods that often cause delays, missed escalations, and customer dissatisfaction.

## Problem Statement
